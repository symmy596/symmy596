### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam Symington, a scientist and programmer. During my academic career I used ab initio and classical simulation techniques to predict and analyse the properties batteries, fuel cells, catalysts and nuclear fuel. In addition to research, I have taught several undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Bath, introducing students to Python programming and it's application in the chemical sciences.
